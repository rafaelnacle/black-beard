# Black Beard: A responsive guitar shop

This is a simple project, the aim here is to make it fully responsible
and utilize relative units and flexboxes. I already did websites using this tech
but it's a great refresher since I'm getting back to front-end.

Most of the content it's just fictional, the links and buttons aswell.
